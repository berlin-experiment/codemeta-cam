Academic Project for Two Modules at CODE University of Applied Sciences: A group based project divided into sub-projects. I worked on designing, building and testing prototypes for the Audio team. My project used various camera modules and webcams paired with OpenCV and Darknet YOLO object detection to count the number of individuals in a given space and play the appropriate sound loop which is layered based on the number of people detected within the space. In its early stages of development, the project sought to translate the audio environment of the actual world into the meta campus by counting the number of people in a certain area of the university campus and outputting the desired audio loop in the meta version of the campus. As time went on, my modules for this project ended and more recent prototypes were employed to replicate wildlife ambient rather than the planned office setting.A group based project divided into sub-projects.

Learning Goals
Build on existing coding skills with [C programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [C++.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
Learn more about [metaverse](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-the-metaverse/) concepts and applications.
Better my understanding of the gap between the [virtual experience](https://www.iberdrola.com/innovation/virtual-reality) and the real-world experience and how to potentially bridge it.
Develop the knowledge and skillset to design [schematic diagrams](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/studentzone/studentzone-february-2017.html#:~:text=I%20like%20the,in%20the%20circuit.%E2%80%9D).
